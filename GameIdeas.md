# Game Ideas
I think that multi-platform (Windows and Mac) should work for now. We can expand later if we want to or scale down if it seems like too much work. 

- Kanye side scroller: people like this idea, could be fun need to think of a story. Maybe North West has been captured by South East or something silly like that. 
- Sand box dungeon crawler: need to find something “new” to be different from other dungeon crawlers. Maybe try and make combat more close combat rather than a dungeon shooter. 
- Open world: maybe based in Corvallis? Design would be complicated but could be good.
- Kill your friends with rudeness: self-explanatory.
- Silly simulator: these seem to be all the rage maybe we could do a snail simulator with a boost button that does nothing
- Puzzle game: this wouldn’t be procedurally generated but could be fun. 
- Artistic game: We could try and get Arianna in on it because she is good at art. Meghan as well 
- Sneak game: try and not get caught doing things 

## Misc. Questions to think about:
What platform should we use to make the game? I know that game maker is good for 2D games, however Unity and Unreal are good for more detail and have lots of physics stuff built in. 

Should we go 8 bit or not? 8 bit would probably be easier for design and stuff like that.  However we could do simple art for the game and then go from there.
